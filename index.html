      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>The Institute for Coherence Research is a collective of boundary-pushing researchers committed to exploring the frontiers of time, space, and emergent structure through the lens of mathematical abstraction and dynamic systems theory.<br><br>
      We believe that the answers science has yet to find may not lie in what is already known—but in the questions that have gone unasked, or unanswered, for too long.<br><br>
      Our work is driven by a willingness to simulate the unthinkable, challenge foundational assumptions, and seek coherence in the seemingly chaotic. We are guided not by discipline, but by pattern. Not by consensus, but by what holds together—under stress, over time, and across fields.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>At our core, we build simulations—<em>not to confirm</em>, but to <em>break</em>.<br><br>
      Our lab designs digital models that push hypotheses into failure zones, mapping the limits of stability, decay, feedback, and emergence. We treat code not as automation, but as extension: of mathematical theory, of philosophical tension, and of the scientific method itself.<br><br>
      Whether through discrete lattices, continuous PDEs, or multi-agent field simulations, we use math not to preserve certainty, but to provoke deeper insight.<br><br>
      We explore dynamics like:<br>

      <h2>What We're Working On</h2>
      <p>Our primary research focus is the Coherence-Regulating Field (CRF)—a memory-integrated feedback framework that models how order resists decay by remembering its own persistence.<br><br>
      CRF is rooted in variational calculus, Lyapunov stability, and real-time simulation—and it may offer the foundation for a new class of pattern-preserving systems across physics, computation, and biology.<br><br>
      Concurrently, we pursue background studies in dimensional mathematics—explorations into how fields may interact across topological boundaries and temporal asymmetries. We ask whether coherence can cross dimensions the same way it crosses space: not by force, but by feedback.<br><br>
      These aren’t side projects. They’re echoes of the same question:<br>
      <em>What lets structure persist when the universe is built to forget?</em>
