  <h1>Research: The Coherence-Regulating Field</h1>
  <p>
    The Coherence-Regulating Field (CRF) is a theoretical framework that introduces a universal feedback field
    capable of preserving coherent structures in noisy or diffusive systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    CRF proposes that in regions of high structural order, an auxiliary field H(x,t) senses that order and dynamically reduces its rate of decay.
    This results in longer-lasting patterns—whether physical, chemical, or biological.
